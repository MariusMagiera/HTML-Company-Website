# Responsiveness 

## Skeleton-Sass
For the responsive styling I used Skeleton Sass as a highly modular version of Skeleton CSS build on top of the popular CSS metalanguage, Sass.  
Check out the docs for more information: https://github.com/atomicpages/skeleton-sass  
Please remember to compile the styles.css file after changing styles in the /parts folder. This will recompile the styles.scss file.  
  
For those who do not like it, there is a styles-only-css.css file as well. 

## JPanelMenu 
To implement the mobile menu I used the JQuery Plugin JPanelMenu.
